# Crop Disease Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves working with a dataset of crop disease images from Uganda. The goal is to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into five distinct categories. The project emphasizes improving model performance through advanced techniques such as Transfer Learning and Callbacks.

## Key Features

By completing this project, you will:

- **Explore a crop image dataset**: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- **Build and train a CNN**: Create a neural network to classify images into five classes.
- **Improve the model using Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained image classification models for better performance.
- **Identify overfitting**: Detect and mitigate overfitting in your model.
- **Evaluate model performance**: Use k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- **Optimize training using Callbacks**: Implement techniques like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping to enhance training efficiency.

# Wildlife Conservation in Côte d'Ivoire

## Project Overview

This project focuses on assisting scientists in tracking animals within a wildlife preserve in Côte d'Ivoire. By participating in this data science competition, you'll develop and expand your machine learning skills to classify images from camera traps. These images will be analyzed to determine which animal, if any, is present.

The end goal is to create a powerful neural network model capable of processing images and classifying them into one of multiple categories.

## Objectives

1. **Image Classification**  
   Develop a system to classify wildlife images into categories based on the animal species or absence of animals.

2. **Neural Network Development**  
   Build and train an effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image data.

3. **Practical Application**  
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images.

4. **Competition Submission**  
   Format the model predictions for submission to the competition platform.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn how to read image files and preprocess them for machine learning tasks.
- Gain experience using **PyTorch** for tensor manipulation and neural network construction.
- Understand how to design and implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** optimized for image analysis.
- Explore methods to improve model performance and prediction accuracy.
- Translate model outputs into a format suitable for competition evaluation.

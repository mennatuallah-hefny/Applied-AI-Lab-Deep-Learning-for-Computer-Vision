# Project Overview

In this project, you'll participate in a data science competition aimed at helping scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve. The objective is to analyze images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. This challenge will allow you to expand your machine learning skills by creating powerful neural network models capable of classifying images into multiple categories.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Reading and Preparing Image Files**: Learn how to read image files and prepare them for machine learning.
- **PyTorch Basics**: Understand how to manipulate tensors and build a neural network model using PyTorch.
- **Building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Develop a CNN that effectively processes and classifies image data.
- **Making Predictions on New Images**: Use the trained model to make predictions on unseen images.
- **Competition Submission**: Transform predictions into a format suitable for submission to the competition.
